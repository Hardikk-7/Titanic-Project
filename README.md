# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project is a machine learning solution to the famous Titanic dataset, where the goal is to predict which passengers survived the tragedy based on features like age, class, gender, and more.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using Python and common data science libraries, this notebook walks through the full data science workflow:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for visualizations
- `scikit-learn` for building ML models
- `Jupyter Notebook` for code and documentation

## 📁 Files

- `Titanic_Project.ipynb` — Main notebook with full analysis and modeling
- `train.csv` — Training dataset (from Kaggle Titanic Challenge)
- `test.csv` — (Optional) Test dataset for final predictions
- `README.md` — Project documentation (this file)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Handling missing values
- Label encoding and feature selection
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Model accuracy and confusion matrix
- Feature importance analysis

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hardikk-7/Titanic-Project.git
